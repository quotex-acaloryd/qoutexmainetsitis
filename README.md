Apple\'s App Store enforces strict guidelines to safeguard user safety
and minimize excessive risk. These regulations pose challenges for
binary options platforms seeking approval for listing, including Quotex.

## The Current Status of Quotex on iOS

Regrettably, Quotex lacks an official app on iOS devices. This absence
stems from various factors, including regulatory compliance, risk
assessment, and the potential for misuse of the platform.

seamlessly via its mobile-optimized website. This solution offers a
comprehensive trading experience without missing out on trading
opportunities.
